=====To-Do=====

1. Make objects of parameter, predicate, rule and DatalogProgram classes
	To do this we need to determine what needs to be in these objects using the grammar as a guide
1.5 Follow the "The Parser" slides like the back of your hand broskie!
2. Wrap your head around the Predicate class




Work on Parser class. Work on Predicate class--(Predicate constructor so the Parser::parseQuery function can work). 
	Buff out the Parser class to add scheme, fact, query, and rule objects to the datalogProgram vectors during the parse.


Working through Parser.cpp and making sure that all of the grammar things have the correct additions (predicateObject.addParamater())
as well as point to the correct item in the parse. I'm just kind of doing my best, then compare with Bryce, then do my best, then compare, etc

xxxxxxxMake stuff print out before ()
xxxxxxPopulate Domain Set (in datalogProgram.cpp look for places that say addDomain())
xxxxxxx Spaces between tostring and colon

Work out error handling
